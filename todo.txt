# what a mess

- make a tmuxRun() to run things in bg indefinitely
- make a tmuxKill() to kill a process based on it's pid or name?
- fixup checklist or make a new selector, use that everywhere, instead of this mess of bespoke menus
- fix tools like arpspoofs, responder, mitm

# future
- make a keyboard to type at least IPs/ports
- make an interface selector menu, make tools use that
-
